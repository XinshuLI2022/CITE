## Introduction
This is the official implementation for paper ["Contrastive Individual Treatment Effects Estimation" ]()  

The code is built on the [CounterFactual Regression (CFR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03976) for fair comparison.  

## Environments

Same with [CounterFactual Regression (CFR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03976).  

## Usage

**data:** we give ihdp dataset as an example here. You can download other datasets from [here](https://www.fredjo.com/)  
**training:** python cite_param_search.py <config_file> <num_runs>  
**evaluating:** python evaluate.py <config_file> <num_runs>  
**simple command** sh ihdp.sh
